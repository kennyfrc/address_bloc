Patterns:
1. Creating a lexicographically correct address book

Flow Used:
1. Array#insert(index, input)
- inputs: you have a base entries array which a bunch of names
- against index, use a for / each loop with an iterating index
- once you see that your name input is < an entry, then you found the right index
